# Movie App

A small full-stack movie catalog built with React, TypeScript, and FastAPI. It loads movies from the backend and supports title search, genre filtering, sorting, and favorites.

## Development

Start the FastAPI backend from the repository root:

```bash
cd server
uv sync
uv run fastapi dev
```

Then start the React client in another terminal:

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the URL printed by Vite. Requests beginning with `/api` are forwarded to FastAPI during development.

Other available commands:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
npm run preview
```
